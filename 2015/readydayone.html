        More about us and Ready Day One
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Cornerstone team has significant expertise and extensive experience within the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Cornerstone team members are accomplished leaders in their fields, with success in Field Sales, Field Sales Leadership, Medical Affairs, Commercial Sales Training &amp; Leadership Development, as well as experts in the Organizational and Industrial Psychology arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus in the Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Medical Device industries enables us to be revolutionary and remain current with industry trends, customizing each program to specific client needs. Our specialization in this market sector has allowed us to partner with leading companies to identify, develop, and determine the promotion-readiness of thousands of leadership development candidates.  We thrive on the success of past candidates, many of whom have risen to C-suite levels in their respective organizations. As with BI, our clients are truly partners, with relationships spanning several decades.</p>
      <p>
        Cornerstone’s READY DAY ONE™ approach in developing program content is based upon a thorough job analysis of the target roles, functions and skills required for successful job performance and incorporates the core principles and best practices from industrial/organizational psychology.  We recognize that the results of our programs are typically factored into client promotional decisions, and strive to create processes that are universally fair and help protect our clients from employment litigation. Thus, we insist on compliance with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures set forth by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as the Guidelines and Ethical Considerations for Assessment Center Operations endorsed by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).

      <h3 style="color: #902A1C; font-weight: bold;">
        Our Four Step Process:
      </h3>
      <br>
      <h4>
         <strong style="background-color: #3D85C6; color: #FFFFFF; padding: .25em;">Nominate</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Cornerstone’s trademarked two customizable assessments, <strong>Management Potential Review&trade;</strong> (MPR) and <strong>Business Knowledge Interview&trade;</strong> (BKI), are designed to help ensure that the best candidates are nominated for the MDP. These assessments are easily adaptable to any FLSL role in the BI organization. The content of the nomination assessments focuses on core competencies, critical behaviors and key skills known to generalize to success in individual contributor and FLSL roles. This also encompasses general knowledge of emerging industry trends, comprehension of organizational initiatives, and FLSL job specifications. Results of these assessments are combined and candidates are selected for the MDP based on predetermined success criteria.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h4>
        <strong style="background-color: #CC0000; color: #FFFFFF; padding: .25em;">Explore</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        After candidates are nominated, they experience the <strong>intraspec&reg;</strong> developmental Realistic Job Preview (RJP), which enables candidates to engage in a series of real-life, FLSL simulations during an evaluation-free setting. During the RJP, candidates receive developmental feedback from both coaches, who are experienced FLSLs and/or directors within the organization, as well as peers. 

        The RJP primary purposes are the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Allows candidates to explore the FLSL role and confirm their interest in pursuing the management career path.</li>
          <li>Enables candidates to craft unique developmental plans based on feedback from the simulation experience with input from their coaches and mentors. </li>
        </ul>
        Developmental plans are clustered around core competencies, critical behaviors and key skills known to be critical for FLSL success.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h4>
         <strong style="background-color: #FF9900; color: #FFFFFF; padding: .25em;">Build</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        FLSL candidates execute elements of their individualized development plans. Cornerstone offers proprietary content and learning modules, <strong>leadership ASCENTials&reg;</strong>, directed on basic leadership and management skills, including decision-making, coaching, etc. to support this effort.  Based upon our expertise in this arena, the average timeframe for development is 6 – 9 months in order to sustain candidate motivation, while providing sufficient opportunity for skill development.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h4>
         <strong style="background-color: #FFD966; color: #FFFFFF; padding: .25em;">Certify</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Candidates are ready to attend the Cornerstone-administered customized TBAC, where they are assessed through real-world scenarios and simulations. Candidates are ‘tiered’ for readiness and provided extensive feedback along with coaching guidance to ensure they are <strong>READY DAY ONE&trade;</strong>.<br><br>

        The readiness center typically consists of 5 – 7 simulations focused on key functions of the FLSL role.  All simulation content is customized and developed by aligning with BI leadership and sales training to ensure each scenario evaluates specific competencies, skills and behaviors for the BI-specific commercial team.  Candidate performance is evaluated by position content experts from BI, including experienced FLSLs and/or Regional Sales Directors. Working together with Cornerstone-led experts, these BI evaluators assess individual candidate performance from the simulations to arrive at a consensus-based evaluation to determine candidate readiness for promotion. Candidates deemed “Ready Now” are eligible for immediate promotion. Those considered “Not Ready” are given feedback as to what additional development is required before they are upgraded to promotion-ready status.<br><br>
