        Employees who are prepared for a new job before they even get there will be much
        more efficient and effective from the very first day. The need for on-the-job training is

        <br>
        People are more inclined to stay with their current employer when an established
        career path is in place. This saves your organization the significant time and expense
        required to recruit, hire and train new employees.<br><br>
